<SubHeading>Introduction</SubHeading>
<Paragraph>
    QuickFlags is a fast, simple flag knowledge game. It's designed to help you
    learn flags in a fun way.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
    This page describes how I've desided which flags to include, among other
    things.
</Paragraph>

<SubHeading>Which flags are included?</SubHeading>
<Paragraph>
    The basis I've decided to follow is flags that are relevant to the context
    of country flag knowledge.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
    This means I haven't just compiled a list of UN Member countries, but
    instead decided if each country can be argued as a one and is deemed
    relevant to the context of the game.

<Paragraph
    >No. Despite how political countries and flags are, I will try to keep this
    game a-politcal. I will not be removing any country's flag from the game as
    protest or a sign of support. The point of the game is to help build flag
    knowledge, not be a politcal statement.</Paragraph
